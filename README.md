# Multi-LLM Telegram Bot ü§ñüöÄ

Welcome to the Multi-LLM Telegram Bot project! This versatile bot brings the power of GPT and Claude AI models directly to your Telegram chats, allowing to prompt both GPT and Claude through Telegram to easily compare the responses from both models. There are also  image generation capabilities and special chat modes. 

I currently run this bot on a self-hosted Raspberry Pi2 running Raspbian. Most of the workload is on the LLM hosting side (e.g. OPenAI or Anthropic) and the resource useage on the bot side itself is quite low - of course, this may vary significantly depending on how many users run your bot. The bot is currently built with the assumption that useage will be limited with a low number of users (yourself, friends and family). 

## üåü Features

- **Dual AI Integration**: Interact with both GPT and Claude AI models.
- **AI Comparison**: Compare responses from GPT and Claude side by side.
- **Image Generation**: Create images on-the-fly using DALL-E.
- **Special Chat Modes**: Customize your AI interactions with predefined modes. [=> WORK IN PROGRESS]
- **Image Understanding**: Send images to the AI models for analysis and discussion. [=> WORK IN PROGRESS]
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor your API usage and associated costs. [=> WORK IN PROGRESS]
- **Conversation History**: All interactions are saved for future reference. [=> WORK IN PROGRESS]

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/derdide/telegram_multi_llm_bot/
   cd telegram_multi_llm_bot
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_TOKEN= add your telegram bot token, as provided by Botfather
   OPENAI_API_KEY= add your openai api key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= add your anthropic api key
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini (or change with another model)
   OPENAI_TOKENS= 16000 or adapt _
   ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-opus-20240229 (or change with another model)
   ANTHROPIC_TOKENS=4000 or adapt
   IMAGE_GEN_MODEL=dall-e-3
   ```

5. **Set up the database**
   The bot will automatically create the necessary SQLite database when it first runs.

6. **Create a `chat-modes.json` file**
   This file should contain your custom chat modes. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "creative": "You are a highly creative AI assistant.",
     "professional": "You are a professional business consultant AI.",
     "casual": "You are a friendly and casual conversational partner."
   }
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Start the bot**
   ```
   python telegram-bit-main-bot.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the bot on Telegram**
   - Start a chat with your bot on Telegram
   - Use the following commands:
     - `/start`: Get a welcome message and basic info
     - `/help`: View available commands
     - `/gpt <message>`: Interact with GPT
     - `/claude <message>`: Interact with Claude
     - `/compare <message>`: Compare responses from GPT and Claude
     - `/image <prompt>`: Generate an image based on the prompt
     - `/mode <mode_name>`: Switch to a special chat mode
     - `/balance`: Check current API usage and costs

3. **Send images**
   - You can send images to the bot, and it will include them in the AI analysis

## üìä API Usage and Costs

The bot tracks API usage and estimated costs for each interaction. Use the `/balance` command to view a summary of your usage.

## üîê Security Note

Keep your `.env` file secure and never share your API keys. The bot stores conversation history and API usage in a local SQLite database. Ensure you comply with data protection regulations if deploying this bot in a production environment.
